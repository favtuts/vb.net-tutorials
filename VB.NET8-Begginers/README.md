# Lesson 4: Variable in Visual Basic

Create new project:
* Project name: VariableUnderstanding
* Solution name: VariableUnderstandingSolution

![Create-Variable-Understanding-Project](./images/VB.NET8-06-create-variable-understanding-project.png)

To declare a variable using keyword `Dim` (stands for Dimension). Dimension means we are saying in the memory you should hold this variable temporarily with certain data. Visual Basic is going to take care of that entirely you don't have to worry how the memory functions behind the scene. All you need to now `Dim` is the keyword to declare a variable with the specific type example String.
```vb
Dim FirstName As String
```

Next, we are going to assign some value to this variable:
```vb
FirstName = "Shane"
```

Now we will use this value to show the message:
```vb
MessageBox.Show("Good morning " & FirstName & ". How are you?")
```

# Lesson 5: Data Types

We have the properties of iPhone with different data types:
    * Brand = Apple (String)
    * Model = iPhone 16 (String)
    * Battery = 4500 (Integer)
    * ScreenSize = 6.7 (Double)
    * Price = $799.99 (Decimal)
    * Availability = True (Boolean)

Use the ampersands symbol (`_`) before the variable to break line of it is too long
```vb
Dim StrBrand As String
Dim StrModel As String
Dim IntBattery As Integer
Dim DoubScreenSize As Double    '15->16 Digits
Dim DecPrice As Decimal         '28->29 Digits Higher Precision
Dim BoolAvailability As Boolean

StrBrand = "Apple"
StrModel = "iPhone 16"
IntBattery = 4500
DoubScreenSize = 6.7
DecPrice = 799.99
BoolAvailability = True

MessageBox.Show(StrBrand & " " & StrModel & " " & IntBattery & " " & _
                DoubScreenSize & " " & DecPrice & " " & BoolAvailability)
```


# Lesson 6: Input Box

We are going to create a form to get input data for First Name, Last Name, Email
